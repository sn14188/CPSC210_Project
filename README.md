# Avoid Poops

## *Or You Die*

This project provides a simple game.
Anyone who has played games in the form of avoidance when young can easily access and enjoy this. <br>
What I felt for the first time after leaving Korea and coming to Vancouver was that
there are so many people having pets.
There are much more advantages of staying with them, but also inconveniences
which is that some of them leave their poops intact without getting rid of.
So I always have to look at the ground not to touch it when I walk.
And if I step on it, I will feel bad all day long.
This reminded me of a game to **avoid poops falling randomly from the sky.** <br>
