# Let's Avoid the Rain

## A Squirrel on Campus

It rains a lot on the nature-friendly UBC campus. When we go to the classroom or library, often
see squirrels in the rain. They are gathered under trees to avoid rain, or they eat nuts
from trees or people. This project is a simple form of game. It will provide a sweet break for
students who are tired of challenging assignments and exams. <br> <br>
**A squirrel** on the screen should *avoid raindrops* that fall randomly, and at the same time
they can score by *catching foods* that fall randomly as well. There are three types of falling
food, and if you make it continue to eat the same type of them, you can get a combo score. When
the squirrel get rained a lot, it will get sick and the game ends. <br> <br>
I could first think of my behaviour not to step on the puddles when it rains. Then I came up with
this type of game. <br> <br>
