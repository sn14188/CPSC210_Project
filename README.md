# Avoid Poop

## *Or You Die*

This project is a simple game.
Everyone has played a similar game when they were young and should be able to play this easily. <br>
What I noticed after leaving Korea and coming to Vancouver was that
there are so many people having pets.
There are many advantages of having pets, but there are also inconveniences.
Some people do not clean up their pets' poop!
So I always have to look at the ground not to step on it when I walk.
Because otherwise, I will feel bad all day long.
This reminded me of a mobile game **avoid poop falling from the sky** that I used to play as a teenager. <br> <br>
